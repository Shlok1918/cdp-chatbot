# CDP Chatbot System

The **CDP Chatbot System** is a Python-based chatbot designed to assist users with documentation and queries related to **Customer Data Platforms (CDPs)** such as **Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap**. It scrapes documentation from these platforms, indexes the content, and provides intelligent responses to user queries.

## Features

- **Documentation Scraping**: Automatically scrapes and indexes documentation from multiple CDP platforms.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Uses **NLTK** for query processing and **sentence-transformers** for semantic search.
- **Intelligent Responses**: Generates step-by-step guides, comparisons, and detailed answers based on user queries.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a **Flask-based** web interface for easy interaction with the chatbot.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to support additional **CDP platforms** or documentation sources.
